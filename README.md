Statistics on App usage data

The data was all non-normal, but this code can: 
1. Test Normal distribution: Shapiro Wilkes test ; histograms ; qqplots (for multiple parameters)
2. Test mean differencet   : Wilcoxon test ; box plots ; mean difference calculations
3. Test correlations       : Spearman ; Pearson ; dotplots
4. Permutation MANOVAs     : non-parametric MANOVA alternative for 3 varaibles, using permutation tests (Anderson method) to increase robustness

Vizualisations with ggplot: 
- Box plots
- QQ Plots
- correlation plots
- Distribution histograms

- Faceted plots for many parameters

The project was completed in October 2020
